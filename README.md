Real Estate App

Let's user list their properties in a simple and quick way.

Tech Used :

--> Vite + ReactJS + React Router for Frontend --> NodeJS + ExpressJS for Backend --> MongoDB Database

Deployment :

--> Webpage is deployed using Vercel. --> Backened(Server) is deployed using Render, first time submitting the data might take upto 50 seconds because of the free backend deployement restriction after that it should be fine.

Note :

Please keep in mind that the delay present while submitting the data for the first time is only there because of the free deployment restriction on Render becuase Render puts the server on sleep when not being used thus causing the delay, the first submission could take upto 50 seconds caused by the time taken for the server to start after that any other submission should work just fine and with adequate speed.
